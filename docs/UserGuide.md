ExcoLink is a **desktop app for exco members of large university CCAs or clubs to manage their club members and subcommittees, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface 
(GUI). If you can type fast, ExcoLink can get your member management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ExcoLink.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar excolink.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   - `list` : Lists all members.
   - `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com` : Adds a member named `John Doe` to ExcoLink.
   - `delete 1` : Deletes the 1st member shown in the current list.
   - `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL [r/ROLE] [sc/SUBCOMMITTEE]` can be used as `add n/Ernest p/91133915 e/sengernest12@gmail.com`.

- Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[r/ROLE]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `r/Treasurer`, `r/President r/Secretary`, etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL`, `p/PHONE n/NAME e/EMAIL` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Editing the data file

ExcoLink data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/excolink.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, ExcoLink will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ExcoLink to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

---

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ExcoLink home folder.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
